Issue:
- Running `crate2nix generate -f Cargo.toml -o Cargo-generated.nix` directly -> generates the tracked `crate-hashes.json`
- Running `cat_ifd_generated_crate_hashes > crate-hashes-ifd.json` -> generates the tracked `crate-hashes-ifd.json`

This shows how the package ID used with IFD is not the same as would otherwise be generated by `cargo metadata`.
It seems that this may prevent cargo from matching
